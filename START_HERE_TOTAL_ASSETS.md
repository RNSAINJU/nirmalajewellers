📋 RECEIVABLES = Money customers owe you
✅ TOTAL = Everything you own combined
```

### The Percentages Show

Example: If Ornaments = 60%, Raw Materials = 20%, Others = 20%
Means: 60% of your wealth is in finished jewelry
       20% is in raw materials
       20% is in other inventory and customer debts
```
