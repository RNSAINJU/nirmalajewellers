## 💡 HOW IT CALCULATES

### Ornament Values
```
For each ornament in stock:
  Gold Amount = (Gold Weight ÷ 11.664) × Current Gold Rate
  Silver Amount = (Silver Weight ÷ 11.664) × Current Silver Rate
  Diamond Amount = (Diamond Weight ÷ 11.664) × Current Gold Rate
  
Total = Gold Amount + Silver Amount + Diamond Amount
```

### Raw Materials
```
Raw Gold = Metal Stock Gold Quantity × Current Gold Rate
Raw Silver = Metal Stock Silver Quantity × Current Silver Rate

Total = Raw Gold + Raw Silver
```

### Other Inventory
```
Stones = Sum of all stone cost_price
Motimala = Sum of all motimala cost_price
Potey = Sum of all potey cost_price
```

### Order Receivables
```
Receivables = Sum of all pending order total amounts
(Orders not yet converted to sales)
```

### GRAND TOTAL
```
TOTAL ASSETS = 
  Ornament Values +
  Raw Materials +
  Stones +
  Motimala +
  Potey +
  Receivables
```
