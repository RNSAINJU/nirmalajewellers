## 🎯 The Balance Sheet Explained Simply

### The Core Concept
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ASSETS = LIABILITIES + EQUITY                 │
│                                                 │
│  What You Own = What You Owe + What's Left    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Real Example
```
Your Jewellery Business Today:

ASSETS (What You Own):
├─ Debtors (customers owe you): ₹100,000
├─ Orders (pending orders): ₹250,000
└─ Sales (completed sales): ₹400,000
   TOTAL: ₹750,000

LIABILITIES (What You Owe):
├─ Creditors (suppliers): ₹200,000
├─ Salaries (pending): ₹150,000
└─ Expenses (costs): ₹50,000
   TOTAL: ₹400,000

EQUITY (Net Worth):
   ₹750,000 - ₹400,000 = ₹350,000
   
VERIFICATION:
   ₹750,000 = ₹400,000 + ₹350,000 ✅ BALANCED
```

## 🔍 The Three Parts Explained

### 1. ASSETS 💰
**What the business owns/controls**
- Money owed by customers
- Pending orders value
- Completed sales value

### 2. LIABILITIES 🏦
**What the business owes**
- Money owed to suppliers
- Pending salaries
- Business expenses

### 3. EQUITY 👑
**Owner's net worth**
- What remains after paying all debts
- Grows when business profits
- Shrinks when business loses money

---

## 📊 Understanding the Numbers

### Positive Equity = Healthy Business ✅
```
Assets > Liabilities
Example: ₹750,000 > ₹400,000
Equity: ₹350,000 ✅
```

### Negative Equity = Troubled Business ❌
```
Assets < Liabilities
Example: ₹200,000 < ₹250,000
Equity: -₹50,000 ❌
```
